libsolclient_dynamicJudy library

The libsolclient_dynamicJudy library allows the freedom to use the Judy library of choice with the libsolclient library.
However, Solace does not provide support under product maintenance plans for Judy versions other than the version tested with.

Platform Specifics

Windows
The libsolclient_dynamicJudy.dll library will depend on the Judy.dll library.

UNIX 
The libsolclient_dynamicJudy.so library will depend on the libJudy.so library.
If you wish to statically link with Judy, you can replace the version of Judy in the libsolclient.a archive with the one of
your choice using the ar tool.

Here are some useful commands to access or modify modules in the libsolcient.a archive.

List archive modules : ar -t libsolclient.a

Replace archive modules : ar -r libsolclient.a libjudy.o

IOS 
The solace api does not have a dynamic libary for this IOS platform so there is no libsoclient_dynamicJudy library.
The libsolclient.a archive can replace judy modules using ar however there is an extra step to access the judy modules.
The libsolclient.a archive is universal for ios architectures so the architecture specific archive must be extracted first.

Here is a command to extract architecture specific archive from libsolclient.a:
lipo libsolclient. a -thin armv6 -output libsolclient_armv6.a

For ar commands see UNIX

Here is a command to combine architecture specific archives into libsolclient.a:
lipo libsolclient_<ARCH1> libsolclient_<ARCH2> ... libsolclient_<ARCHN> -create -output libsolclient.a
